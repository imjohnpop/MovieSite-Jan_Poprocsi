                        <h3>Quick, spoiler-less thoughts from Hollywood Premiere Attendee</h3>
                        <p>Rogue One was quite awesome, and quite different from the movies that came before. It was frightening,
                            tense, very dark, VERY dirty (literally: maybe Mon Mothma was the only character without a layer
                            of filth make-upped onto her face. And she looked so much like Mothma from ROTJ!) Some differences
                            were somewhat striking, but overall it absolutely felt like a Star Wars movie should feel. Lots
                            of familiar faces to see, super tense and exciting and beautiful. I was SO fortunate to be able
                            to attend the premiere at the Pantages Saturday night, and can't wait to see it again Thursday
                            night! There's never been a better time to be a Star Wars fan!</p>

                        <h3>I feel like the void left in my heart by episode VII has been filled now.</h3>
                        <p>Maybe it's because I had higher expectations for episode VII and almost none for this one, I feel
                            like this movie managed to achieve what the other one couldn't. I'm not saying that it was perfect,
                            but it sure was good enough for me, and it will be good enough for many other die-hard SW fans.
                            Leading female actor wasn't that good in my opinion, but otherwise this movie had everything
                            a SW fan could wish for. Good old characters, good old places, and an overall good old SW feeling.
                            Fits into the story line quite well, CGI was a bold move , could've gone bad, but it played out
                            quite nicely. Overall I think SW fans will love it, but anybody not deeply immersed in the saga
                            would also enjoy it.</p>
